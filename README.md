# ✅ Task 5 – Capture and Analyze Network Traffic using Wireshark

## 🎯 Objective:
To capture live network traffic using Wireshark and perform a basic analysis to identify key protocols, communication patterns, and encryption methods.


## 💻 System Details:
- 📶 Interface: Wi-Fi
- 🌐 IP Address: 192.168.1.4
- 📅 Date of Capture: 06-06-2025
- 🛠 Tool: Wireshark (on Kali Linux)


## 📦 Steps Performed:

1. Opened Wireshark and selected the active Wi-Fi interface (e.g., wlan0).
2. Started the packet capture.
3. Generated traffic by visiting a secure website (e.g., spotify.com).
4. Captured traffic for approximately 30 seconds.
5. Stopped the capture and saved the file as task5_capture.pcap.
6. Analyzed the captured traffic to identify main protocols.


## 🔍 Protocols Observed:

| Protocol  | Description                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| TCP       | Used for reliable data transfer (3-way handshake) |
| TLSv1.2   | Encrypted HTTPS traffic (older version) |
| TLSv1.3   | Latest version of secure encryption protocol |
| QUIC      | Modern fast protocol over UDP (used by Spotify) |
| UDP       | Used by QUIC for lightweight transmission |


## 🧠 Notable Observations:

- TCP 3-way handshake observed: SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK.
- TLS handshake observed including Client Hello and Server Hello.
- QUIC traffic shows use of modern, fast, encrypted protocols.
- Most communication was encrypted (port 443 – HTTPS).
- Traffic originated from and to IP: 192.168.1.4.

## 📁 Files Attached:

- task5_capture.pcap – Wireshark capture file.
- report.md – This analysis report.

## 📌 Conclusion:

This task successfully demonstrated real-time network packet capturing and protocol analysis using Wireshark. Traffic generated by visiting a secure website was captured, showing encrypted communication using TLS and QUIC protocols. The `.pcap` file provides a real example of how modern encrypted internet traffic looks in a network analyzer tool.
