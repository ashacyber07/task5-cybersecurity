# ✅ Task 5 – Capture and Analyze Network Traffic using Wireshark

## 🎯 Objective:
To capture live network traffic using Wireshark and perform a basic analysis to identify key protocols, communication patterns, and encryption methods.


## 💻 System Details:
- 📶 Interface: Wi-Fi
- 🌐 IP Address: 192.168.1.4
- 📅 Date of Capture: 06-06-2025
- 🛠 Tool: Wireshark (on Kali Linux)


## 📦 Steps Performed:

1. Opened Wireshark and selected the active Wi-Fi interface (e.g., wlan0).
2. Started the packet capture.
3. Generated traffic by visiting a secure website (e.g., spotify.com).
4. Captured traffic for approximately 30 seconds.
5. Stopped the capture and saved the file as task5_capture.pcap.
6. Analyzed the captured traffic to identify main protocols.


## 🔍 Protocols Observed:

| Protocol  | Description                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| TCP       | Used for reliable data transfer (3-way handshake) |
| TLSv1.2   | Encrypted HTTPS traffic (older version) |
| TLSv1.3   | Latest version of secure encryption protocol |
| QUIC      | Modern fast protocol over UDP (used by Spotify) |
| UDP       | Used by QUIC for lightweight transmission |


## 🧠 Notable Observations:

- TCP 3-way handshake observed: SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK.
- TLS handshake observed including Client Hello and Server Hello.
- QUIC traffic shows use of modern, fast, encrypted protocols.
- Most communication was encrypted (port 443 – HTTPS).
- Traffic originated from and to IP: 192.168.1.4.

## 📁 Files Attached:

- task5_capture.pcap – Wireshark capture file.
- report.md – This analysis report.

## 📌 Conclusion:

This task successfully demonstrated real-time network packet capturing and protocol analysis using Wireshark. Traffic generated by visiting a secure website was captured, showing encrypted communication using TLS and QUIC protocols. The `.pcap` file provides a real example of how modern encrypted internet traffic looks in a network analyzer tool.






# Interview Questions


# 1. What is Wireshark used for?

Wireshark is a **network protocol analyzer** used to:
* Capture live network traffic
* Inspect individual data packets in detail
* Troubleshoot network issues
* Analyze security incidents
* Learn how protocols work
* 
# 2. What is a packet?
  A packet is a small unit of data sent over a network. Every time you open a website or send a message, your computer sends data in packets.
  Each packet contains:
  *Header: Info like source, destination, and protocol
  *Payload The actual data (e.g., part of a web page)

# 3. **How to filter packets in Wireshark?**
  You can filter packets using the **top filter bar** in Wireshark. Some common filters:
  * `http` – shows only HTTP traffic
  * `dns` – shows DNS queries and responses
  * `tcp` – filters all TCP packets
  * `ip.addr == 192.168.1.1` – shows packets to/from that IP
  Type the filter and press *Enter*

# 4. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?

| Feature     | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) | UDP (User Datagram Protocol)   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Connection  | Connection-oriented                 | Connectionless                 |
| Reliability | Reliable (ensures delivery)         | Unreliable (no delivery check) |
| Speed       | Slower                              | Faster                         |
| Use cases   | Web, email, file transfer           | Video, voice calls, games      |

# 5.What is a DNS query packet?
   A DNS query packet** is sent when your computer asks a DNS server to translate a domain name (like `google.com`) into an IP address.
    Protocol: DNS

# 6.How can packet capture help in troubleshooting?
   Packet capture can help by:
    * Finding delays or dropped packets
    * Identifying unauthorized or malicious traffic
    * Checking if requests are reaching the server
    * Seeing which devices are communicating
    It's like watching what's happening inside your network

# 7.What is a protocol?
   A protocol is a set of rules that define how data is sent and received over a network.
   Examples: 
      *HTTP– Web browsing
      *DNS – Domain name resolution
      *TCP/UDP – Data transport
      *ICMP – Ping

# 8.Can Wireshark decrypt encrypted traffic? 
   Yes, but only in some cases
        * If you have the **encryption key(e.g: SSL key for HTTPS)
        * If traffic is using older protocols (less secure)
        * Most modern HTTPS traffic is end-to-end encrypted, so Wireshark can’t see the content unless special setup is done.
